# KED2022
This repository contains all the material for the following course that I teach at the University of Lucerne:

*Seminar Kleines Einmaleins des Digitalen - Computergestützte Textanalyse: Universität Luzern, 2022*

The course is a gentle introduction to computational methods with a focus on text analysis. The audience are BA students of social sciences with backgrounds in various disciplines (sociology, political science, cultural studies, etc.)

# Acknowledgements

As always, people stand on the shoulders of others. So do I. I am especially grateful for:

- the plentiful resources by [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org) that draw me into the world of Markdown.
- a dataset of speeches given by Swiss Federal Councilors on the Swiss National Day. [Simon Schmid](https://www.republik.ch/~simonschmid) (journalist Republik), with the collaboration of Prof. Andreas Kley (Faculty of Law, UZH), collected many of these speeches and kindly shared the resulting dataset with me. The collection comprises 166 speeches, which is a multiple of the publicly available [here](https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/reden/ansprachen-zum-nationalfeiertag.html).
